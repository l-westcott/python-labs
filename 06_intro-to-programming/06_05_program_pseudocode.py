# Think about a task that you want to accomplish using programming
# Maybe you want to automate something you do every day on your computer?
# Break down some of the steps you can think of and write them in
# this file as pseudocode.
# You can come back and update this file when you've learned more.
# You can also add real Python code after learning the necessary concepts.
# For now, just practice breaking larger tasks into smaller steps
# and writing out your thoughts in pseudocode.

# Identify all formulas in OC that are mismatched between UAT & Production

# 1. Pull UAT data set
# 2. Pull Production data set
# 3. Pull all values under formula & variable name columns for UAT and call it "UAT"
# 4. Pull all values under formula & variable name columns for Production and call it "PROD"
# 5. Do a matching process against the columns and pull mismatches as seperate results
